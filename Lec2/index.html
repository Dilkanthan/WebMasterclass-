           <i>Lorem Ipsum</i>  is simply <b>dummy</b> text of the <strong>printing</strong> and typesetting industry. 
            <small>Lorem Ipsum</small> has been the <del>industry's</del> standard <ins>dummy</ins> text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
             It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
             remaining essentially <mark>unchanged.</mark>
